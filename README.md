# LM Cloud Resource Inventory

## *What is the purpose of the LM Cloud Resource Inventory scripts?*

This solution is provided by LogicMonitor in order to collect cloud resource counts within an AWS or Azure environment, for LogicMonitor licensing.

## *What data is collected by the LM Cloud Resource Inventory scripts?*

The LM Cloud Resource Inventory script records the associated quantity of services/resources based on LM Cloud resource type (IaaS, PaaS, Non-Compute.)
* No other data associated with cloud resources is collected or recorded (for example, resource name or ID.) 
* The output of the script is visible to customers for review, prior to sharing with LogicMonitor.

## *How will LogicMonitor use this data?*

The data collected will be used to accurately scope the quantity of LogicMonitor cloud resource licenses required for quoting. For example, the scripts will return the total number of IaaS or PaaS resources in an AWS account or Azure subscription.

## *What language are these scripts written in?*

The scripts provided are shell scripts that LogicMonitor recommends executing at the cloud provider CLI.

## *Where should I execute these scripts in order to successfully collect data?*

In order to minimize setup requirements, and for purposes of expediency, LogicMonitor recommends execution of the scripts in the relevant cloud provider CLI.

For users with advanced cloud experience, the scripts can also be executed from a local workstation with the AWS or Azure CLIs installed.

## Requirements

**Note:**  Cloud provider CLIs have all required dependencies already installed.

**AWS**
* AWS CLI - [How to install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
* Bash version 5 or later
  
**Azure**
* Azure CLI - [How to install the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
* Required extensions: **resource-graph**, **virtual-wan**
  * ```az extension add --name resource-graph```
  * ```az extension add --name virtual-wan```
* Bash version 5 or later

## *What permissions are required by the scripts to run against my cloud environments?*

The scripts will utilize the permissions of the currently logged-in cloud account, and while the scripts do not execute any write operations against a cloud account, best practice recommendation is to run the scripts with a read-only account.

**AWS**
* Minimum required role: ReadOnly (best practice is to use an account with only ReadOnly access.)

**Azure**
* Minimum required role: Reader (best practice is to use an account with only Reader access.)

## *Does the script make any connections, other than to AWS or Azure?*

No, the script(s) donâ€™t establish any external connections, they simply query Azure and AWS, and write output to a .csv file.

## *How long should it take to run these scripts?*

**AWS**
* The AWS script may take up to an hour as it needs to check per service, per region, for accessible resources. By default all regions are included. It is recomended to use the *-r* regions parameter to limit the scope to regions you are actively utilizing to reduce the overall run time of the script.

**Azure**
* Depending on how many subscriptions are being counted the script typically takes around 2-3 minutes per subscription. By default all subscriptions are included. Subscriptions can be specified using the *-s* parameter.

## How to run the provided scripts?

See below for examples on running the LM Cloud Resource Inventory scripts. For a list of all parameters you can use the *-h* flag to show all options:

**AWS**
```
#Make the script executable
chmod 755 get_aws_resource_count.sh

#Run resource count script for two regions (us-west-1 & us-west-2)
./get_aws_resource_count.sh -r "us-west-1,us-west-2" -o aws_resource_count_output.csv

#Run resource count script for all regions
./get_aws_resource_count.sh -o aws_resource_count_output.csv
```

**Azure**
```
#Make the script executable
chmod 755 get_azure_resource_count.sh

#Run resource count script for two subscriptions (Pay-As-You-Go & Production)
./get_azure_resource_count.sh -s "Pay-As-You-Go,Production" -o azure_resource_count_output.csv

#Run resource count script for all subscriptions
./get_azure_resource_count.sh -o azure_resource_count_output.csv
```

## *What outputs do the scripts provide?*

The script outputs are provided as CSV files that can be reviewed by customers, prior to sharing with LogicMonitor. Unless specified when running the resource count scripts, the default output files names are:
```
aws_resource_count_output.csv
azure_resource_count_output.csv
```

Example CSV output:
```
Category,Number
IaaS,71
PaaS,15
Non-Compute,349
```

## *What should we do with the outputs after we're done running these scripts?*

LogicMonitor recommends reviewing the output(s) of the script(s) prior to sharing with LogicMonitor, so as to ensure comfort with the information being provided.

The outputs can be downloaded from the provider's cloud shell:
* [Download a file from AWS CloudShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#download-file)
* [Download Files from the Azure Cloud Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/persisting-shell-storage#download-files-in-azure-cloud-shell)

## *Where can we get support if we have questions or concerns about running these scripts?*

As these scripts are most commonly utilized in the LogicMonitor pre-sales process, reach out to your friendly neighborhood Sales Engineer or Customer Success Manager for additional support.
